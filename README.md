**Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects, each focused on a different dataset and problem. The projects are implemented using Python, and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Projects Overview

**1. Titanic Dataset Analysis (Task 1)**


Dataset: Titanic-Dataset.csv


Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Description:
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes loading the dataset, examining its structure, and performing basic statistical analysis. Various visualizations are likely used to understand the data better.


**2. Iris Dataset Clustering (Task 3)**

Dataset: IRIS.csv


Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (KMeans)


Description:
The project focuses on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the machine learning community. The primary task is to perform clustering using the K-Means algorithm, with additional exploratory data analysis and visualization.


**3. Advertising Dataset Analysis (Task 4)**


Dataset: advertising.csv


Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Description:
This project involves analyzing an advertising dataset. The analysis includes data exploration, visualizations, and potentially predictive modeling to understand the impact of various features on advertising outcomes.
